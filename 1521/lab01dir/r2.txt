The game consists of a 4 x 4 grid consisting of cells that have base 2 values up to 2048. 
Users can slide cells up, down, left, or right to move all cells in that direction. 
If adjacent cells (in the direction of travel) are equal then they merge and form a
 cell that has value twice as big as either cell (i.e. a base 2 step higher).

Every move a random cell appears in an empty cell.

If all of the cells are filled up in such a way that none can be merged, the game is complete
