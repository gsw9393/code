Test total (3 3 5 5 7 9) - passed
Test match-2 (1 3 4 7 7 9) - failed (Incorrect output)
Your program produced these 1 lines of output:
Rule sequence-2(8,9) - score 35.

The correct 1 lines of output for this test were:
Rule match-2(7) - score 33.

The difference between your output(-) and the correct output(+) is:
- Rule sequence-2(8,9) - score 35.
+ Rule match-2(7) - score 33.

The input for this test was:
1 3 4 7 7 9

You can reproduce this test by executing these commands:
dcc timTam.c -o timTam
echo '1 3 4 7 7 9' | ./timTam
